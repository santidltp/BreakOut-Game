  /**
   * Calculates and applies the velocity and spin change from a bounce
   * of the Ball.  The "factors" indicate how to translate speeds in the
   * x and y directions into the speed parallel to the surface.  If we
   * orient sour view so that the Ball is moving down toward the surface,
   * the speed parallel to the surface is positive if movement is to the
   * right.
   * <br>
   * The equations are derived from the physical analysis presented in:
   * Richard L. Garwin, "Kinematics of an Ultraelastic Rough Ball",
   * American Journal of Physics, 37, 88-92, Jan. 1969.  This determines
   * behavior for a perfectly bouncy ball (elastic collision) with spin
   * that does not slip/slide when bouncing.  A real-world analog is the
   * Superball product by Wham-O.
   * <br>
   * We make two modifications / specializations:<br>
   * 1) Since we operate in two dimensions, our "ball" is a disc.  This
   * makes the moment of inertia 1/2 * M * R^2.  In the conventions of
   * Garwin's paper, this means that alpha = 1/2.<br>
   * 2) Garwin does not consider collision with a moving surface.  However,
   * it is easy to adjust things by considering movement relative to the
   * frame of the moving surface.  We simply subtract the speed of the
   * surface from the Ball's parallel movement before computing what
   * happens in the collision, and then add the speed back afterwards.
   * <br>
   * In Garwin's notation, we end up with:<br>
   * Ca = -1/3 Cb - 4/3 Vb + 4/3 Vs<br>
   * Va = -2/3 Cb + 1/3 Vb + 2/3 Vs<br>
   *
   * Here Va and Vb are the speed of the Ball parallel to the surface
   * after and before the collision, respectively.  Vs is the speed of
   * the surface.  Ca and Cb are R * spin of the Ball, after and before
   * the collision, respectively.  (In Garwin's notation, C = R * omega,
   * where omega is the spin.)
   *
   * @param xFactor an int, -1, 0, or 1, giving the factor by which to
   * multiply the horizontal speed to get its contribution to the speed
   * parallel to the surface
   * @param yFactor an int, -1, 0, or 1, giving the factor by which to
   * multiple the vertical speed to get its contribution to the speed
   * parallel to the surface
   * @param speed a double, giving the speed of the surface; positive
   * is movement to right if we consider the surface as being horizontal
   * with the Ball coming down onto it
