1) I created the PowerUpStrategyDecoratorBall.java
2) I proceed and add an instance of the PowerUpStrateGyDecoratorBall in PowerUpFactory 
	and modify the conditional statement to add else if for our new powerup.
	These two steps are pretty straight forward since we have the PowerUpStrategyDecoratorMiniBall.
	Therefore, It is as easy as just to follow PowerUpStrategyDecoratorMiniBall in order to create
	our new powerup.
3)  Moreover, I created a class under the name BallsDisplay which as you could imagine it creates
	a graphical display for the remaining balls.
	Finally, I made the necessary in BreakOutGame and GameState to make the BallsDisplay work.
